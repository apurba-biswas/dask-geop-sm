# Creating a custom Sagemaker image

This repo creates an docker image on AWS ECR then creates a sagemaker image

See [AWS repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-studio-custom-image-samples) for more examples

Coiled is used to create the conda-docker image hosted on ECR.
This requires an account on Coiled (and setting AWS as the backend)
i.e set software environments to be hosted on AWS ECR

1. Use coiled to create an ECR repository with environment file
```import coiled
coiled.create_software_environment("
	name = <env_name>,
	conda = "environment.yml"
	)
```
Include awscli, boto3, ipykernel in env build to for Sagemaker
		
2. Use docker image in EC3 to create a sagemaker image in Cloud9
    1. get sagemaker executioner role i.e. ROLE ARN and set to env var
    2. provide the docker image in ECR as the sagemaker base image
3. Create AppImageConfig
4. Update domain (add to image to json file)


## Notes

Coiledâ€™s Docker file command
 RUN conda env update -n coiled -f environment.yml     && rm environment.yml     && conda clean --all -y     && echo "conda activate coiled" >> ~/.bashrc
